# facial.detection

The objective is to use a Raspberry Pi 3+ and the camera for the Raspbery Pi and have it act as a security camera with face dection features. The Raspberry Pi should work headlessly, be able to collect faces for training and dectect people's faces that has been trained. We will be using the lastest version of Raspian as of 2/15/2021 as well as OpenCV and xxx. The majority of this walk through was gathered from different articles and videos that will be linked below. Although I didnt go through the OpenCV documentations, this was a good start and at some point I would like to do a complete OpenCV walk through.

Limitations: Exploring OpenCV and the pi's camera was fun but there were some limitations. The pi's camera to wasn't able to capture people's faces from the distance that I wanted it to. The idea was to have it sit on a window sile and gather faces as people walked by. The pi had difficulty capturing people's faces from about 50 feet away and for the face capturing portion, your subject had to be still for several seconds looking directly at the camera. Best results came at about 2-3 feet, anything between 3-6 feet would be identified as "Unknonw" and at 6 feet, it wouldnt pick up any faces at all. I would like to try this again but with a high quality usb camera or with a better pi camera.
